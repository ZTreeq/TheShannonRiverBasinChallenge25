Title : Flood-Radar

Why Does It Matter ?
Throughout time flooding in the Shannon Area across the Shannon basin occurs frequently and is not just a seasonal inconvenience and it continues to be a growing threat to homes , agriculture , biodiversity and infrastructure. Traditional flood maps have always been  simple , static and top ‚Äì down view.

So what‚Äôs missing ? 
Well the answer is that traditional food maps lack local-insight , real time adaptation and diagrams that include story telling which act as a measure of predicting the effects of the flood and what people can do in order to best prepare.

Why Am I The Right Person For This Challenge ? 
There are many reasons I am the right person for this challenge , but in my opinion one of the main reasons why this challenge suits me perfectly is because I am from Athlone and have lived here for most of my life and I have many family members located here too. 

Due to Athlone's location being on the bank of the river Shannon this means that from a young age I have been exposed to the river and just how prone it is to flooding and the damage that it can cause to land and property due to the water damage and I have seen this with my own eyes and I understand just how devastating it is.

I understand that precautions can be carried out in order to prevent / reduce the potential damage that can be caused from the flood via the use of for example, sandbag barriers to prevent water from passing through them.

"Local Eyes Global Vision"

Problem Framing:
How can I create a collaborative yet interactive platform where residents and researchers can simulate possible flood scenarios which may potentially occur in the near future , while also doubling as an interactive platform for residents that allows them to discuss and ask questions to one another about possible future floods and what they should do in order to prepare accordingly depending on the severity of the flood.

‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt just about predication but also about participation and planning.‚Äù

Expected Outcomes :

Flood Radar will empower the 22,000 residents of Athlone to better protect them self‚Äôs from flooding.

A 3D flood simulation tool constructed using Three.JS as it a framework allowing you to utilise 3D models. This would be used to show water levels in specific areas while also clearly highlighting what areas are highly prone to flooding and specific infrastructure vulnerabilities.

A possible solution sandbox simulator where users can drag and drop interventions such as Sand Barriers , Wetlands , Levees and ext.

Flood Radar will complement existing flood maps by adding real-time community-driven simulation.

A community layer where users can interact with each other by discussing ideas to shape future planning against flood protection.

Difficulty  :  Advanced or Intermediate

What makes my solution and approach unique ?
It‚Äôs not just predictive , it‚Äôs interactive and co-designed by the users of the application themselves.

Invites  and allows local knowledge to be considered in the planning process.

Transferable to other flood prone regions and can be re-used in other counties or even countries.

It is inspiring for school students , climate activists and councils.

Scope :
Includes --> 
3D visualization,  community / user input layer, simulation logic, real time environmental data and open source collaboration. Users can enter hypothetical  future climate scenarios like 30% more rainfall in 2040 to explore long-term resilience

Does not Include --> 
Physical infrastructure construction or government policy enforcement and high-fidelity engineering simulations.

Lets build a flood free future together !
